# Learning Data Science

This repository contains multiple notebooks that were used to learn various packages and tools commonly used within the world of Data Science. These are being placed here for a combination of reasons. (1) As demonstration to anyone unfamiliar with me and my work to see the type of work done to learn data science, and (2) So I have a repository that can store all these files incase I need to reference them in the future.
