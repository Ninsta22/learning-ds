    "# Coding Your Own Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "One task that you will almost certainly be required to do other data science courses (especially if you are a MIDS student) is to write up some of your statistical / machine learning models from scratch. This can be a very valuable exercise, as it ensures that you understand what is actually going on behind the scenes of the models you use ever day, and that you don't just think of them as \"black boxes\". \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a little practice doing this, today you will be coding up your own linear regression model! \n",
    "\n",
    "(If you are using this site but aren't actually in this class, you are welcome to skip this exercise if you'd like -- this is more about practicing Python in anticipation of the requirements of other courses than developing your applied data science skills.) \n",
    "\n",
    "There are, broadly speaking, two approaches you can take to coding up your own model: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. you can write the model by defining a new function, or \n",
    "2. you can write the model by defining a new class with associated methods (making a model that works the way a model works in `scikit-learn`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you do 1 or 2 is very much a matter of choice and style. Approach one, for example, is more consistent with what is called a *functional* style of programming, while approach two is more consistent with an *object-oriented* style of programming. Python can readily support both approaches, so either would work fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, however, I will ask you to use approach number 2 as this *tends* to be the more difficult approach, and so practicing approach 2 will be extra useful in preparing you for other classes (HA! Pun...). In particular, our goal is to implement a linear regression model that has the same \"initialize-fit-predict-score\" API (application programming interface -- a fancy name for the methods a class supports) as `scikit-learn` models. That means your model should be able to do all of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** a new model. \n",
    "2. **Fit** a linear model when given a numpy vector (`y`) and a numpy matrix (`X`) with the syntax `my_model.fit(X, y)`. \n",
    "3. **Predict** values when given a new `numpy` matrix (`X_test`) with the syntax `my_model.predict(X_test)`. \n",
    "4. Return the **model coefficients** through the property `my_model.coefficients` (not quite what is used in `sklearn`, but let's use that interface). \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, bear in mind that throughout these exercises, we'll be working in `numpy` instead of `pandas`, just as we do in `scikit-learn`. So assume that before using your model, your user has already converted their data from `pandas` into `numpy` arrays. "
