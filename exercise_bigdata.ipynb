This data comes from the Global Historical Climatology Network, and is the actual raw data provided by NOAA. The only changes I have made to this data are a few small formatting changes to help meet the learning goals of this exercise. \n",

So to import this data you'll have to (a) read the notes about the data in the project README.txt, and (b) read about how to read in fixed-width data in pandas. When entering column specifications, remember that normal people count from 1 and include end points, while Python counts from 0 and doesn't include end points (so if the readme says data is in columns 10-20, in Python that'd be 9 through 20).
